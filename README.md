#CPC Strategy Challenge

###Consider the following scenario:
You're part of a team that has built a web application to collect data for clients' products on popular search engines. The data includes daily keyword rankings for individual products on a popular search engine. 

Every client wants to be at position 1. Your team looks good when the client sees that rankings are improving (towards position 1). Conversely, declining rankings are a cause for concern (away from position 1). 

Luckily for you, there are dedicated analysts on your team to help investigate why something might be declining and take action to address it. 

###Prompt:

Using the example data provided below, create an interface for both your team and the client to view and interact with the data in a meaningful way.
 
Here's an example of your team's raw data in JSON format:
